# Welcome to Naas Drivers üèé

Simple formulas to build highly efficient scripts.<br>
You can check the documentation here: https://docs.naas.ai

## Low code philosophy

We came from excel with the conviction that Python is awesome and much more powerful.
But the number of lines you have to write in Python can be overwelming. <br>

So we created simple low code formulas that tech and non-tech people can use to facilitate integrations with third party tools.<br>

Simple formulas to interact with powerfull tools.<br>
Each driver returns a dataframe to get a strandardized output accross integrations.
